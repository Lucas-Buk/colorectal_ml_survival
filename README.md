# Machine Learning Survival Study

## **Introduction**  

This study was developed by the **Núcleo de Sistemas Eletrônicos Embarcados (NSEE)** at **Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia**, in collaboration with **Fundação Oncocentro de São Paulo (FOSP)**, **Faculdade de Saúde Pública da USP (Universidade de São Paulo)**, and **A.C. Camargo Cancer Center**.  

The objective is to explore the application of **machine learning algorithms for survival analysis** to predict cancer patient survival and identify the most impactful variables in these predictions. The study includes data from patients diagnosed with **cervical, colorectal, lung, prostate, or breast cancer** between **2000 and 2024**. 

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this research is **open-source** and is called **Registro Hospitalar de Câncer (RHC-SP)**, available on the [FOSP website](https://fosp.saude.sp.gov.br/fosp/diretoria-adjunta-de-informacao-e-epidemiologia/rhc-registro-hospitalar-de-cancer/banco-de-dados-do-rhc/).

## **How to Run**  

To run the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:  

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lucas-Buk/colorectal_ml_survival
    ```  

2. Open the notebooks using a **Python development environment**, preferably [Google Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/), but you can also use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) locally.  

3. Install the required Python libraries.

## **Setting Up the Project Locally**  

This notebook was originally developed for Google Colab and uses `!gdown` commands to download the required files. To run it locally:

1. Remove or comment out all cells containing `!gdown`.
2. Download the original dataset (`.dbf`) directly from the [FOSP website](https://fosp.saude.sp.gov.br/fosp/diretoria-adjunta-de-informacao-e-epidemiologia/rhc-registro-hospitalar-de-cancer/cadastro/).
3. Convert the `.dbf` file to `.csv` using the code below.
4. Update the file paths in the notebook to point to the generated `.csv` file.

#### Converting the dataset from `.dbf` to `.csv`

```python
from dbfread import DBF
import pandas as pd

# Read the DBF file
table = DBF("path/to/dataset.dbf", encoding="latin-1")

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(iter(table))

# Save as CSV
df.to_csv("dataset.csv", index=False, encoding="utf-8")
```
**Note**: Install the required package before running the conversion:
``` python
pip install dbfread
```

### **Creating the Virtual Environment (venv)**  

#### Windows  

```bash
python -m venv venv
```  

#### Linux  

```bash
virtualenv -p python3.12 venv
```  

### **Activating the Virtual Environment**  

#### Windows  

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```  

#### Linux  

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```  

### **Installing Dependencies**  

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements/data_analysis.txt -r requirements/ml.txt

```
